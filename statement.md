# Project Statement

## Problem Statement

-   Users often rely on multiple separate tools for managing tasks,
    organizing files, searching notes, writing emails, and tracking
    productivity.
-   Switching between different applications leads to wasted time,
    reduced efficiency, and inconsistent data management.
-   Many existing tools are either too complex, require heavy
    installations, or lack customization options.
-   There is a need for a lightweight, beginner-friendly, and unified
    system that brings together essential productivity tools in one
    place.

## Scope of the Project

-   Develop a fully console-based modular Python application.
-   Provide independent modules for task management, file organization,
    note searching, email drafting, and productivity tracking.
-   Enable smooth navigation between modules through a centralized menu.
-   Use simple JSON files for data storage to ensure portability and
    ease of use.
-   Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows & Linux).
-   Focus on simplicity, readability, and easy maintenance rather than
    advanced UI or complex databases.

## Target Users

-   Students who need a simple system for planning studies, organizing
    files, and tracking progress.
-   Working professionals who handle multiple files, tasks, and email
    communication daily.
-   Developers who want lightweight automation tools to organize
    directories and keep notes searchable.
-   Beginners learning Python who want to understand modular programming
    and real-world application structure.
-   Anyone looking to boost productivity without using heavy software or
    web-based apps.

## High-Level Features

-   **Task Manager:** Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed
    with persistent storage.
-   **File Organizer:** Automatically classify files into folders based
    on extensions.
-   **Note Search System:** Search for keywords across `.txt` files with
    matched line display.
-   **Email Draft Generator:** Create ready-to-edit email templates for
    academic or professional use.
-   **Productivity Logger:** Record daily work logs with timestamps
    stored in JSON format.
-   **Central Navigation Menu:** Unified interface to access all modules
    easily.
-   **Error Handling:** Handles invalid inputs, missing files,
    unreadable folders, and corrupted data gracefully.
-   **Modular Architecture:** Each feature is separate, maintainable,
    and reusable.
